============

Whole idea behind is to create web application based on object model without additional coding. 
Application has two parts - designer and workspace. There are applications widgets on main screen 
with example applications (World Census, Plants, Cosmonautics). Each application consists of several 
object types with attributes and relations. User can see object types in tree on main application page. 
There are object types like "Continent", "Country", "Locality" in application "World Census". 
For each object type user can see all objects of this type in multilevel tree. Values of objects are displayed 
in template on the right side. There are more than 150000 localities in mentioned application. 
User can search within objects from application's main page. Everything is fully configurable 
(including trees, lists, templates) in designer. (See https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7bW5Gy1s3y8 for details).
